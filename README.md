Implement a custom collection of integers that allows to:
* add, when adding a new element, increase the value of each arrays element by the value of the new one.
* delete, when removing element, decrease the value of each arrays element by the value of the removed one.
* find element by value
* find element by index
* find maximum
* find minimum
* find average value of elements

  NOTE: Invalid imput for NULL and other characters but integers

myArrayList is an ArrayList of Integer

remove(),
addNew(), 
getMax(),
getMin(),
getAverage()
 // methods for accessing and manipulating the above list

bollean add(),
Object get(),
bollean contains()
 // methods supported by ArrayList

* Invalid imput for NULL imnpleneted by using "if condition" checking for NULL in add() and addNew() methods
* Invalid imput for other characters but integers imnpleneted by adding Integer type to the list of parameters in add() and addNew() methods
